# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this activity, I worked with @mohseenHamid to build a simple rock-paper-scissors game using only JavaScript.

### Goals

* The game was developed considering the following scenarios:

* As a user:
  * I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.
  * I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
  * I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.
  * I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.
  * I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after 10 rounds.

* The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.

* Follow your pseudocode as much as you can, and if you get stuck don't worry, this is a challenging assignment.
